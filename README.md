## ðŸš€ Serious Game to Stimulate Cognitive Skills in Visual Perception and Hand-Eye Coordination

This serious game has been designed and developed to help children with cognitive disabilities, aged 4 to 14, improve their **visual perception and hand-eye coordination skills**. Players achieve this by organizing different patterns across multiple levels.

The game was developed using **Unity and C#** and includes the following features:

- **Three levels**, each with specific patterns to arrange.
- **Time limit** to view a pattern before it disappears, requiring players to recall and organize it.
- **Audio feedback** indicating whether a response is correct or incorrect.
- **Orchestral music** that enhances the atmosphere of each level.
- **A distractor character** that introduces an additional challenge for the player.
- **Scoreboard** to track progress.
- **Reward system** with stars based on performance.
- **Scoring based on precision and attention** when solving patterns.
- **Avatar selection**, allowing players to choose a character to represent them.

## Reflection

The design and development of this game were primarily aimed at helping children with cognitive disabilities enhance their visual perception and hand-eye coordination by organizing patterns at different levels.

For its design, the **iPlus methodology** was applied, following its phases: user identification, pedagogical objectives definition, Ludic Game Script creation, gameplay design, and refinement phase. As a result, a document was created detailing **user profiles, storytelling, game mechanics, and gamification elements**. These mechanics were later transformed into epics and developed using the **Scrum methodology**, with C# and Unity.

The game development posed several challenges, such as selecting the right mechanics to translate real-world activities into a digital experience. The **drag-and-drop** mechanic was chosen, allowing children to recognize cards through **basic shapes, characters, and colors**. Additionally, a **music and reward system** was implemented to maintain player engagement, along with distractor characters that enriched the experience while keeping the project's educational goals intact.

Since **the game is 2D and primarily relies on drag-and-drop** mechanics, Unity was chosen as the game engine. Unity provides a wide variety of assets, tutorials, and a strong community, which helped resolve technical challenges during development.
